They've covered the city with a plastic dome
So the air inside could be clean
And it's really fine in our new home
We have everything we need
There are no planes, no buses or trains
And if you wanna go somewhere
Just think about where you'd like to be at
And before you know it you're there
Living in the future in a plastic dome
Sounds mighty strange I agree
But now I call it home sweet home
That's where I long to be, yeah
Living in the future in a plastic dome
Sounds mighty strange I agree
But now I call it home sweet home
That's where I long to be
Now if you're hungry for food or drink
Just go to the teller machine;
You place your order and you just have to think
And look at the video screen
But if you're lonesome and you think you would
Like to have a friendly chat
Just talk to the teller machine
And the teller machine will talk back
Hey, living in the future in a plastic dome
Sounds mighty strange I agree
But now I call it home sweet home
That's where I long to be, yeah
Living in the future in a plastic dome
Sounds mighty strange I agree
But now I call it home sweet home
That's where I long to be





When my grandpa was a boy
He went down to the general store
Saw a picture book of a whale
Shooting its spout and flashin' its tail

Then he got a sailor's dream
'Bout cruisin' around on the salty sea
Joinin' up with a fishin' crew
To go out and get him a whale or two

Tell me what kind of men are these
Who sail upon the salty seas ?
Up in the rigging in the afternoon
Swabbin' the decks and sharpenin' harpoons

Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning

There're lots of whales in the deep blue sea
We kill them for the company
We drag 'em 'longside and chop 'em in two
And melt 'em down and sell 'em to you


There hardly is a sailor alive
Who can keep the tears from his eyes
As he remembers the good old days
When there were no whales to save

Thank the Russians and Japanese
For scouring the deep blue seas
Looking for ivory and perfume
And plastic toys and pet food

Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning

Shanghaied by the light of the moon
Put out from Boston in the middle of June
After six months out at sea
It's nothin' but death and misery

Set out on a three-year cruise
A union ship and a union crew
And after six months you begin to see
That whalin's not what it used to be

A modern ship and a modern crew
With sonar scopes and explodin' harpoons
A mechanical boat made outta steel
A floating machine built to kill the whales


Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning

When my grandpa was a boy

The glaciers near the polar cap
Have all begun to melt
Temperatures are on the rise
Far from the southern belt

Water levels shifting tides
On every changing land
Rain forests in the Amazon
Have vanished from our hand

And the trees are all gone
Yeah you know it's all wrong
And the trees are all gone

The people want to eat today
And so they clear the land
Global warming is a concept
They can't understand
But all the politicians now
They have no excuse
They just hide behind their power
And keep us from the truth

Man has tried his suicide
With bigotry and hate
But in the end he'll kill himself
With nothing but his waste


What will finally happen when
The farm lands turn to dust
When only rich receive the food
And nothing's left for us

But all the politicians now
They have no excuse
They just hide behind their power
And keep us from the truth



Scarecrow on a wooden cross
Blackbird in the barn
Four hundred empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five
I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
There`s no legacy for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren`t enough to pay the loans
Couldn`t buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
"John, it`s just my job
And I hope you understand."


Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don`t make it right
But if you want me to
I`ll say a prayer for your soul tonight

And grandma`s on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man`s dignity
He can`t work his fields and cows

There`ll be
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

There`s 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain


Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me so proud
Son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow


So you cut all the tall trees down
You poisoned the sky and the sea
You've taken what's good from the ground
But you left precious little for me

You remember the flood and the fall
We remember the light on the hill
There should be enough for us all
But the dollar is driving us still

River runs red
Black rain falls
Dust in my hand

River runs red
Black rain falls
On my bleeding land

So we came and conquered and found
Richers of commons and kings
Who strangled and wrestled the ground
But they never put back anything

Now I'm trapped like a dog in a cage
Wherever the truth is pursued
It must be the curse of the age
What's taken is never renewed

River runs red...



To my old brown earth
And to my old blue sky
I'll now give these last few molecules of "I."

And you who sing,
And you who stand nearby,
I do charge you not to cry.

Guard well our human chain,
Watch well you keep it strong,
As long as sun will shine.

And this our home,
Keep pure and sweet and green,
For now I'm yours
And you are also mine




It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
It's nature's way of telling you in a song
It's nature's way of receiving you
It's nature's way of retrieving you
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong

It's nature's way of telling you, it's in the breeze
It's nature's way of telling you, dying trees
It's nature's way of receiving you
It's nature's way of retrieving you
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong

It's nature's way, it's nature's way
It's nature's way, it's nature's way

It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
It's nature's way of telling you in a song, oh
It's nature's way of receiving you (it's nature's way)
It's nature's way of retrieving you (it's nature's way)
It's nature's way of telling you something's wrong
Something's wrong
Something's wrong





UV rays
Oh, what a day
To write down this endless story
So blow me away
From this porch on a date
And don't let the world ignore me

It's Global Warming Day
You're gonna wanna change
When everyone is baked
We're gonna wanna change

God makes
And man takes
It's all the same, just don't stand there
In my space, in my place
In my bidet and deep end, yeah

It's Global Warming Day
You're gonna wanna change
When everyone is baked
We're gonna wanna change

Turns out the clout was on the take
They turned us out, and now we wait
They threw us all away
On Global Warming Day





Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Where's the air?
Where's the air?
Where's the air?
After car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz
Sealed away from my sins
I'd have the music high going 95
Too much too much too much too much
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
Don't you care?
Don't you care?
Don't you care?
After car after bus after car after truck
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian
Breathing all this in
I look up at that grey sky
It makes me want to... (ohhhh)
Too much too much too much
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear.
