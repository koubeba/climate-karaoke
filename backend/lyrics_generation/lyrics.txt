We need to wake up
We need to wise up
We need to open our eyes
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

Weâ€™re on a planet that has a problem
Weâ€™ve got to solve it, get involved
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

Make it greener
Make it cleaner
Make it last
make it fast
and do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

No point in waiting
Or hesitating
We must get wise, take no more lies
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?

Dear Future Generations,
I speak for the rest of us
I speak for the rest of us when I say
Sorry we left you with our mess of a planet
Sorry that we were too caught up in our own doings
Sorry we listened to people who made excuses
excuses to do nothing
We just didn't realize how special the earth was
We didn't know what we had until it was gone

You know what is the Amazon Desert
Once there was the Amazon Rain Forest
Oh, you don't know much about trees, do you?
Well let me tell you that trees are amazing
We breathe the air the trees are creating
Trees clean up our pollution
trees that store and purify water,
We burned down our trees.

most of us today don't care about tomorrow
we put profit above people
Greed over need
the rule of gold above the golden rule
We used nature as a credit card with no spending limit
We had the nerve to call this destruction "Progress"

climate change is a threat
rising sea levels flood our homes
glaciers are melting away
do you love the smell of fossil fuels
It can be denied, not avoided
Our footprints became a sinkhole and not a garden
ice is melting in the arctic
I'm sorry we didn't find another planet to move to
This is a future I cannot accept
We are the root, we are the foundation, this generation
It is up to us to take care of this planet
It is our only home, we must globally warm our hearts
Change the climate of our souls
Realize that we are not apart from nature
We are a part of nature
To betray nature is to betray us
whatever you're fighting for:
If we don't all work together to save the environment We will be equally extinct

I believe it's not too late
Together we can change the world
Lay the puzzle pieces out find out what it's all about

Can't do it by myself so I'm asking for your help
Sail past where it's been charted
Roll your sleeves up
let's get started

With our hands and with our hearts We can dare to make a start
What if we spoke with one voice, Knowing that we have a choice?

Change your mind and change your life
Set aside the fear and strife
When we open up our eyes then we start to realize
together we can change the world

Yeah, it's time to work, live life sustainable
I feel like that's a goal that's attainable
Recycling can and bottles and glass

I've been called upon to save the planet
The only problem is I can't do it singled-handed
Unplug your xbox, all electronics
Cuz it uses energy even when you're not on it

Don't throw away that bottle, recycle
don't drive around town, please bicycle
Look good, save the environment and feel great

We gotta reduce, find a new use
the planet is already taking too much abuse
It's time to go green
live environmental
clean up the earth
treat our planet more gentle
I gotta live life more eco-friendly
So choose to walk instead of driving your bentley

Captain Planet much like a hero
I can take your carbon footprint down to zero
I encourage you to all buy local
Voice concern, spread the message and be vocal

This is an open letter from you and me together
Tomorrow's in our hands now
Find the words that matter, say them out loud
make it better somehow
Looking down from up on the moon it's a tiny blue marble
Who'd have thought the ground we stand on could be so fragile?

This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe
'Cause it's our world
it's our world

It's not about possessions, money or religion
How many years we might live
When the only real question that matters is still
A matter of perspective

See mama earth is in a crazy mess
It's time for us to do our best
From deep sea straight up to everest
She under crazy stress unless you wanna be motherless
Clean heart, green heart is the way I stress
Speediness and too much greediness
Six billion people all want plentiness
Some people think this is harmless
But if we continue there'll only be emptiness

The Earth is mother, she will take care of us
The Sky is our Father, we will take care of him
The Sea is our Sister, we will take care of her
The Forest is our Brother, we will take care of him

Put out the fire
Our house is on fire

We love you, we hear you
We commit to change our ways
Not later, but sooner
Right now, for your future

Youth canâ€™t wait
Planet canâ€™t wait

For our children
For our children and their children

For songbirds, for clean air
For the oceans and the bays

Melting glaciers
Rising seas
Bleaching coral

Shrinking shorelines
Sinking islands
Growing drylands

Let bees live
let trees grow
Let the snow fall where it may

We're in it together forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
We need clean air around us all
Land to walk on and Waterfalls
But the world is changing day by day
Listen to what we say
One by one
We can spread the news on out how to stop
Pollution blues
Together were reaching out to you
To help us save the Earth
Earth were in it together
Forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
Imagine our world
Clean and litter free
From the ocean to the sky
Join our hands
Share the vision we can see
Let's begin by taking pride

Is it really over?
The echoes just seem to get longer
How did we get here?
There's so much love in us

And all I have left is my faith that I can change
I can't watch this burn
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world say it's now or never
'Cause it's not too late
If we change our ways
And connect the dots to our problems

I can hear the whole world sing we're in this together
We're in this together

Picking up the pieces
I listen out for beating hearts
Now it's time for healing
The sun will rise but this time it's so bright

And all I have left is my faith that we could change
'Cause I can't watch us lose
I can't watch us lose what we've found

You'd have thought we'd learned
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world say it's now or never
'Cause it's not too late
If we change our ways
We're in this together

So you cut all the tall trees down
you poisoned the sky and the sea
You've taken what's good from the ground
But you've left precious little for me
You remember the flood and the fall
we remember the light on the hill
There should be enough for us all, but the dollar is driving us still
River runs red, black rain falls, dust in my hand
River runs red, black rain falls, on my bleeding land

Woke up this morning to the news
The big men were fighting over all weâ€™ve got to lose
But something there was missing from their talk
something that could change us all

Oh no, there it grows
Itâ€™s building up to take over our world
But who is brave, and knows the road, that leads us all to where we need to go
Away from the Shadows
Itâ€™s hard to fight for something you canâ€™t see
But weâ€™re so close now, canâ€™t you feel its ferocity
Look at the families huddled in distress
Look at the houses lost in the mess
Look at the waves crashing as we run
Look at the burning embers of the sun
Look at the tears on the motherâ€™s face, her child swept away to another place
Some may say we can have it all but if we live like this then watch us fall

Spur your hearts, render your souls
Big men sacrifice your name for the cause
And lead us away from these shadowsâ€¦

UV rays
Oh, what a day
To write down this endless story
So blow me away
From this porch on a date
Don't let the world ignore me

It's Global Warming Day
You're gonna wanna change when everyone is baked
We're gonna wanna change
God makes and man takes

I went walking in the wasted city
Started thinking about entropy
Smelled the wind from the ruined river
Went home to watch TV

And it's worse when I try to remember
When I think about then and now,
I'd rather see it on the news at eleven
Sit back and watch it run straight down

I can see it with my eyes closed
Run straight down

We've been living in the shadows all our lives
Stand in line and don't look back
Don't look left and don't look right
We hide our eyes and wonder who'll survive
Waiting for the night

Fluorocarbons in the the ozone layer
First the water and the wildlife go
Pretty soon there's not a creature stirring

Oh, Mother Earth, with your fields of green
laid down by the hungry hand
How long can you give and not receive
feed this world ruled by greed

Oh, ball of fire in the summer sky
Your healing light,
your parade of days
betrayed by the men of power

Oh, freedom land
Can you let this go
Respect Mother Earth and her healing ways
Don't trade away our children's days

I was a monkey dancing in the trees
Out where the jungle used to be
Before the lumber company took my home away from me
Save me
Speaking for those who cannot speak
It takes a thousand years to make what can be wiped out in a day
Bulldozers plowing through the rain
Another forest washed away

You can you take of her
Maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination
Oh the earth is calling out,
I wanna learn what it's all about,
But everything I read global warming going green
It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do matters
everything you do matters in some way

Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don't change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom

I wanna walk up the side of a mountain
I wanna walk down the other side of the mountain
I wanna swim in the river and lie in the sun
I wanna try to be nice to everyone

Did you think that your feet had been bound
Did you feel you were tricked by the future you picked?
Come on down
We're coming down to the ground
There's no better place to go
We've got snow up on the mountains
We've got rivers down below
We're coming down to the ground
hear the birds sing in the trees
the land will be looked after
We send the seeds out in the breeze
Did you think you'd escaped from routine
By changing the script and the scene?
You're always afraid of the change

The rains have come early
We're all gonna wash away
Well, that's all right with me
If heaven's torrent can wash clean
The arrogance that lies unseen
In the damage done since we have gone where we ought not to be
Goodbye to a river
Lakes and levees, dams and locks
They put that river in a box
It was running wild
men must have control
We live our lives in starts and fits
We lose our wonder bit by bit
We condescend and in the end
We lose our very souls

There's a man workin' in a field
See's the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
the color of the fields is turning
Far away the men too busy getting rich to care
Close their eyes and let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the world around you
Far away they bend the rules so secretly
Close their eyes and let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobody else would see

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things that you said
We were to gain
What about killing fields
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores
What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
What about flowering fields
What about all the dreams
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
I know we've drifted far

We've got to learn to reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle

When will we listen to heaven above?
how will we return?
we've been tempting fate
When will we see a light upon the ocean.
There's a new world waiting
When will we see rebirth
This island Earth
Maybe our moment is gone
Maybe we've stood and watched a moment too long
So why do I believe?
the truth's too much to take
how can we face it if we only look the other way

Wipe that smile right off your face
There must be one place left in the world where the mountains meet the sea
There must be one place left in the world where the water's real and clean
One place left in the world
a landslide hummin, a downhill runnin
