What is the future of our planet?
It's hard to say
I've got to live life life sustainable
So choose to walk instead of driving

The fight for clean air
The fight for clean water
The fight for clean land
But if the world is changing, so are we
By now, we have to accept the idea that everything we do has a cause

The End Times are Nearing
Listen to what we say
A lot of things can go wrong

Making it easier to build a better future
Make it
This is our world
Tomorrow's in our hands now
We've been called upon to save the Earth
The only problem is I can't do it singled
We need to build a better future
Can't do it by myself

The planet is warming
You're gonna wanna change when everyone is baked

Let's be real
This is a game changer
We need to build a better future

I can't watch this burn
I can't watch this tear down
I can't watch this
There is no new world waiting
To be explored
To be discovered
To change the world

Big men pray that we could all live life to the fullest
That's all I get

Our planet is getting hot
We're in it together
From the ocean to the sky
Join our hands
Share the vision we have
We're gonna wanna change
Let's talk about ethics
Honest conversation is the way I stress
We need to work together
The world is changing day by day
Listen to what we say
We need to solve it, get involved
Make it greener

The world's oceans are getting warm, wetter, and meaner
We've got to do

Saving our water land and air
This is our planet

I encourage you

You can't watch this burn
You can't watch this tear down
You can't watch this

I've been called upon to save the planet
The only problem is I can't do it singled
We run on sand and the rivers and the bays are melting
Look at the glaciers are melting
Doesn't matter what you're fighting for if we don't all work together
We need a new generation of leaders
Generations past looked the other way

The sun will rise but this time it's so bright

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world say it's now or never

Take a deep breath.
Think about what it's all about.
It's a new year, and that means it's time for you to do your best

Can you imagine
But then there was the storm
The rains were taking a toll
the land was turning

Today's news, read it in full

Next time you're in a jam, think big
Are you tired of hearing about global warming
When will we stop?
Saving our land
I have a confession to make

But by late afternoon, the remains of the storm
The smoke from the fires
It's hard to argue against progress
But you know what, it's not too late

From the ocean
Going green
Inspiring each other to do it better
I can't watch this burn

Leave it to me
To save the planet

The fate of the planet is in our hands now
How many years we might live
Do you like the smell of fish?
Do you like the taste of fish?

The World Will Never Be the Same

We're gonna wanna change
If you want to preserve the environment
You need to reduce fossil fuels
The Agenda for A Green
Like the rest of us, we want to do it all better
Protect the environment
Make it
The only problem is I don't have the words to describe it

It's hard to fight for something you can't see
But we're so close now
We need to build a better future
You gotta live life sustainable
Don't throw away
This is an open letter from you, the people
To the rest of us in darkness

What are you waiting for?
The world's on fire
Look what I found
When I think about our planet
I think about how we can all work together to save it

But the truth is out there, and it's dark
Today's challenges require us to learn together
To transform the world

We believe you, we hear you
We commit to change
From the ocean to the stars
Keep it safe
'Cause It's not often that a city can claim to be a global village but it's happening now

In the midst of the chaos, we must find a way Home
The world is on fire and you're not supposed to be watching
We're supposed to be asleep
Every time we close our eyes
We start to lose sight of what's really important

Some things in life get in your way
When you think about it, it's not too late
We all lived our lives in hope
But something changed when you walked

Not later, but sooner
Right now

The climate is changing day by day
The biggest fish in the sea they live in harmony
We've got to learn to live together
These days, no matter what you're fighting for, you're gonna get it

We turn now to the Arctic Ocean
I can't let this slide

For the past five years, we've been witnessing the catastrophic effects of global warming
It's time for us to do our best
To reduce,
The Earth is our Mother, we are her children
we share her in our hearts, in our souls
Not long ago, the world was a better place.
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars

Tell me about yourself
Tell me about your life
I will make it better
By listening to what we say

If you want to build a better future, start by listening
Don't delay, get started
Don't look back, look forward

Don't stand idly by
You're gonna change tomorrow
This is a moment to reflect
Look at the big picture
In this age of short-term solutions, climate change is a threat
rising sea levels flood our homes
glaciers are melting away

Together we can change the
The Warming Of The World

Are you a fan of free speech
If so, I invite you to join me

The word "climate change" has become an oxymoron.

We're so close now, how far can we go?
Realm of the Rising Sun

How many years we might live
When the only real question that matters is still
A matter of perspective

This is a disaster
We need to do something about it

New ways of thinking

Is it really over?
The echoes are just getting louder
The United Nations is asking for a "climate change fee"
If we don't all work together to save the environment We will be equally extinct

What's that? You've been called upon to save the planet?
You've got the resolve, the drive and the will to do it?

If we don't change today, we will always be in this dilemma

Look what we did
live and let live
clean up the earth

I can run
I can swim
I can bike

It's not too late
Cut your carbon footprint
We're in it together
You're gonna wanna try this out
Come on out
buy local
Think Globally
Because everything you do matters
Everything you do matters

Make it environmentally friendly
Make it fast
What about global warming
I'm not talking about future generations
I'm talking now

A vision from the stars
A vision from the

We all want clean air around us all
But the world is burning

We need a change
Real change
Not some lip service
Making excuses
We need to get active
The beginning is now

That's right, we need to talk

Change your mind and change the world

In a world where money talks, and words don't mean anything,
I speak for everyone

If you want to solve the world's ills, then you need to work
Get involved

I believe
Stop, Listen and Decide
Sea turtles are disappearing at an alarming rate
We need to do something about it
We are at a crossroads
The only problem is I don't know where we are

The Dark Side of the Moon
The truth is very, very hard to find
This is a secret that we must all share
Where is the love in me?
Where is the fire in me?
Where is the ocean
To hear the men's voices together
To spread the news on out how to stop pollution
Fighting for Climate Justice
Do you love hearing stories about how you can do it
Now it's time for action

Clean up the earth and recycle
Now that you're awake
Make it better somehow
Find the words that matter, say them out

If you don't like it, don't buy it

Don't throw away that bottle
This is a threat we cannot ignore

The city is about to get a lot greener

I've been searching for a way
When the weather is fine,
When the snow falls where it may

It's time for us to do something about it

don't drive

This is a conversation
The effects of climate change are already being felt.
Floods are getting worse.

Look
Until you change, you will continue to struggle
So you want to build a better world
But you can't do it single-handed
Look at what's left of the old
It's A Wonderful World
There's A Light At The End Of The Tunnel
Starting today, I'm going green
If you've ever wanted to create a better world,
Or if you just want to get started

So there we go again, another day
Another day, another famine
Another day
The fact that we live in an age of change is not something to be denied
Opening up our eyes
Can't do it on my own
You've been called upon to save the planet
The only problem is I can't do it alone

I don't know about you, but I find it difficult
It's hard to find a good place to work
But we can, with the right tools

The ground is warming up

The oceans and the bays
Melting glaciers
Our mission to save the planet
To make the world a better place
You've got to give the world a chance

The snow is fallingâ€¦.
We're gonna get off our butts and do it now

We're sorry this has come to this
But the truth is out there
Look what we did

53The world's eyes are on us
They're on us every day
They're on us now

Are you ready for the future
The only problem is I can't see it
We all want to be happy
Let's get real here, we're all in this together

we used to fish we'd see plankton
The future is now
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
Do you like to drive your bentley
But you've got to learn to slow down
Who wants to live life sustainable?
That's a goal that's attainable
